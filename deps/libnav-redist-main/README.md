# libnav-redist
This is a pre-compiled version of libnav. The binaries are located in lin64 and mingw64 directories for linux and windows(using mingw) respectively. You should link these binaries statically to your project if you're using libnav. Note, that mac os is not yet supported. If you can compile the library for mac([source](https://github.com/BRUHegg/libnav)), you can add the binary to this repository by opening a pull request.
